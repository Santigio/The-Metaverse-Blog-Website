            Later this year, the Metaverse, as we have come to know it, caught
            the attention of many. And one of the essential players scouting or
            at least known for the Metaverse is Facebook. It is even now called
            Meta. According to FB 2021, Mark Zuckerberg laid out the vision of
            the Metaverse as the successor to the mobile internet â€” a set of
            interconnected digital spaces that lets you do things you cannot do
            in the physical world. Other giant tech companies like Apple, Google
            and others also complement Facebook's vision for the Metaverse.
            Furthermore, the excitement for the future of the Metaverse has
            attracted investors, tech enthusiasts, professors and entrepreneurs.
            Google, just like other huge companies, believes that the Metaverse
            is just an extension of virtual reality or augmented reality.
            Nevertheless, Facebook thinks otherwise. Zuckerberg believes that
            the Metaverse is just a continuation of the company's mission and
            social apps today rather than being something entirely different. As
            he clearly stated, "In our DNA, we build technology to bring people
            together. The Metaverse is the next frontier in connecting people,
            just like social networking was when we got started." This vision,
            of course, might seem too far-fetched, but we know from history that
            FB has done a lot in bringing the world closer and making the world
            a better place for everyone. We have seen some of the products they
            have made and others still in the pipeline, like the VR Oculus and
            Facebook augmented reality glasses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Facebook vision for the Metaverse is a lot more complex and broad.
            Moreover, it sought to connect all apps and anything digital.
            According to him, people will wear glasses that overlay information
            like directions, notable places (businesses, landmarks, etc.), and
            people's names (as may be limited by people you had previously met
            before and exchanged contact information with). The other
            significant promise is floating screens that could be how (when
            paired with a keyboard for typing) you work. There was a time when
            smartwatches were hyped to replace smartphones. In retrospect, that
            was never going to happen, as wrist-worn wearables could never be
            productivity devices for reading and heavy text input. So the
            question we should be asking is, will Facebook make releases of meta
            products before the other giants like Apple, Google and
             dominate as they have done. I think the Metaverse will be
            more like a collaboration than a competition. Because let us face
            it, each big company depends on one way or the other on other
            companies. I am just speculating -- this might happen or not. But we
            pray it does. Let us know what you think about it.
