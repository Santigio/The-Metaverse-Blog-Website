          Marne Levine, Meta's chief commercial officer, stated that the utility of the metaverse for education aids in
          the administration of classes.


          According to Mark Zukerberg, education in the Metaverse will transform how everything works.
          Teachers and students have reached a new level of understanding in dealing with technology as a result of the
          mid/post-pandemic educational context.
          That also means we've developed techniques for dealing with the constraints we experience, particularly in
          synchronous classes!
        </p>
        <p>
          Metaverse will be able to combine technology that can assist expedite online delivery through creative and
          modern solutions in order to drive digital education to new heights.

          Because we've seen how the epidemic has expanded the learning gap among students, blended learning has shown
          to be beneficial, particularly in distant learning when students only have access to their peers and teachers
          via the Zoom program.

          The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), for example, provides a 60:40 ratio of
          real-time Zoom sessions to pre-recorded lessons to its students. Students praised the combination structure
          for its effectiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The benefits of the metaverse include the ability to create new experiences that go beyond online schooling.

          According to virtual campus visits, colleges will be able to break through the global barrier that separates
          students and instructors from all over the world. Students and parents will no longer need to drive large
          distances to see the school, instead depending on Metaverse's virtual world.

          For example, the Kenya-KAIST virtual campus, which will open in September 2023 60 kilometers from Nairobi,
          would allow the university to expand its reach across continents, bringing students together in a'metaverse'
          without them having to leave their native country.
